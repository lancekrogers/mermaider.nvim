# What Actually Improved

## Before (render-bug-fix branch):
- ✅ Basic rendering worked after fixing the CLI command
- ❌ Re-rendered every save even if nothing changed
- ❌ Files with same name in different projects overwrote each other
- ❌ Generic error messages from mermaid CLI
- ❌ Only worked with .mmd files
- ❌ Had to render entire file

## After (Phase 1 + 2):
- ✅ Basic rendering still works
- ✅ **Caching**: Skip re-render if content unchanged (faster on save)
- ✅ **No collisions**: SHA256 hashing prevents overwrites
- ✅ **Better errors**: "Syntax error at line 5" vs raw CLI output
- ✅ **Markdown support**: Render mermaid blocks in .md files
- ✅ **Partial rendering**: Select text and render just that part
- ✅ **Custom styling**: Use your own CSS for consistent look

## How to Test the Improvements:

1. **Test Caching** (most noticeable improvement):
   ```
   nvim test_improvements.md
   :w  (renders and shows "Rendered diagram")
   :w  (should show "Using cached render" - instant!)
   ```

2. **Test Markdown**:
   - Open any .md file with mermaid blocks
   - They render automatically

3. **Test Visual Selection**:
   - Select some mermaid text
   - Press `<leader>mr`
   - Only selection renders

## The Real Benefits:
- **Performance**: Caching makes frequent saves much faster
- **Flexibility**: Work with markdown files, not just .mmd
- **Safety**: No more losing renders due to filename collisions
- **Debugging**: Actually helpful error messages

The improvements are incremental but meaningful for daily use. If you don't use markdown files or don't care about re-rendering, the benefits are less noticeable.
